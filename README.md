## Documentation

Initialize the variable with AddToCalendar struct of this package. And initialize the fields of this package with your data as example shown below.

```javascript
a := addtocalendars.AddToCalendar{
    Title:                   "My teaddtocalendars", // Title of the meeting
    Details:                 "Test details", // details of the meeting
    Location:                "Mumbai", // location of the meeting
    Timezone:                "Asia/Kolkata", // timezone in which meeting is going to happen
    EventStartUnixTimestamp: time.Now().Unix(), // start time of the meeting
    EventEndUnixTimestamp:   time.Now().Unix() + 3600, // end time of the meeting
}
```

After the initialization just call the method for this struct or data as shown below.

```javascript
eventUrl, err := a.AddToCalendar()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("err in add to calendar: ", err)
    return
}
```

This method will return two variables,
1) **eventUrl**: Actual calendar url which you can redirect to browser and it will open the calendar page with the data you have passed.
2) **err**: Error (If the url could not generate due to some runtime error then you can handle with this variable).
